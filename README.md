# Week 0 Project
## Headline Analysis
The data for this week's challenge is Global News Dataset. This dataset comprises news articles collected over the past few months using the NewsAPI. I am using the Starter Python Package as the foundation of my solution.
## Task 1
1. Setup development  environment: I have set up a basic Python development environment using the python -m venv myenv command
2. Created the task-1 branch from master
3. Checked errors using Flake8 and modified the Makefile to remove unnecessary targets
